## I get error messages "tsbpd wrap period begins/ends". What does it mean?

Messages about TSBPD wrap period are informational. These are not errors. SRT just informs that the timer used to track packets is close to overflow and is ready to be reset. There is nothing you should do about that. It is just to inform about this situation.

For more information please see the [TSBPD Wrapping Period](protocol/tsbpd/latency.md#tsbpd-wrapping-period) section.

## I get error messages "No room to store incoming packet..." What does it mean?

This error message is usually related to the buffer sizes. See also \#703.

The Default receiver buffer size is approximately 96 Mbits.This buffer should store all the packets within the specified latency, and also have some space for the application to read \(FFmpeg\).  
You might probably need to increase the buffer size, by appending to the following URI  
"srt://0.0.0.0:9999?pkt\_size=1316&mode=listener"  
the following querry values can be added:  
sndbuf - Send buffer size \(in bytes\)  
rcvbuf - Receive buffer size \(in bytes\)

Other FFmpeg SRT URI options can be found [here](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/libsrt.c#L92).
